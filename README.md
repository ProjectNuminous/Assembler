# Project Numinous

> Project Numinous is currently in an alpha state. The currently in-dev features can be found at the bottom of the document.

The Project Numinous assembler is a macro-oriented assembler taking principles from higher level languages to allow an orthodox scripting pipeline for rich conditional assembly. As a result of new compile time features Numinous offers the most powerful macro scripting capabilities in `2a03-6502` targetting Assembly, producing code optimal in both the generic and edge case contexts. It's targetted for new Assembly developers with a friendlier, clean, C-immatitive syntax with optional safety nets for beginners and total control with config scripts and pragmas for the expert.

Supporting over 20 languages, anyone can easily get started on their Windows, Linux or Mac computer with a deeply configurable and completely portable executable. Written in C# Numinous focuses on the feature set of the language, ensuring the code-base is easily changeable for anyone seeking to contribute or fork! Be it adding/changing mapper support, appealing a language add/change, documentation suggestions or a contribution to the standard library Numinous will always been an open source tool.
